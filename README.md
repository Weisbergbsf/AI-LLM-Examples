# AI-LLM-Examples

## 1 - Large Language Models (LLMs) and Models

### What are they?

- LLMs are AI models trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human-like text. Think of them as super-smart text predictors.
- Examples: GPT-based models, BERT, LLaMA, etc.
- Free framework: Hugging Face’s ***transformers*** gives you access to tons of pre-trained models.

Python Example: Using a Pre-trained Model  
Let’s use Hugging Face to load a simple model and generate text.


## Prompts

### What are they?

- Prompts are the instructions or input you give an LLM to guide its output. A good prompt can make a huge difference!
- Example: "Write a poem" vs. "Write a funny poem about a cat in a hat."

Python Example: Playing with Prompts  
Using the same model, let’s tweak the prompt.
